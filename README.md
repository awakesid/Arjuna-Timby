# Arjuna-Timby  
Arjuna is the python script that uses a camera to track your hand and arduino based laser turret (aka Timby) will follow your hand with high accuracy.   
made this as a college project in a short deadline and I am too lazy to rewrite the code to make it readable : ) sorry 
- open Arjuna.py and put Angles.py in the same folder as Arjuna.py
- make sure to install opencv, cvzone, mediapipe, numpy and serial libraries
- open Timby.ino in Arduino and upload it to your microcontroller
- run Arjuna.py after ensuring the com port is same to which your arduino is connected to
- it should work!

- the stl files for the turret are in the stl folder
